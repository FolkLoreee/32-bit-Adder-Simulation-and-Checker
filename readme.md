# Circuit Simulation and SAT Solver 

## 32-bit Full Adder Circuit Simulation
A simple circuit simulation done in jsim (proprietary language by MIT), which is a part of the 50.002 Computation Structures course.
This circuit follows a similar concept to the Brent-Kung adder circuit, but with slight modifications which enhance the runtime of the adder (by running 2 16-bit adders asynchronously).

## 2-SAT Solver
A SAT Solver program developed in Java. This program takes a .cnf file as the input, and verifies whether the circuit is logically possible (Satisfiable).
This program is a deliverable for the 50.001 Introduction to Information Systems and Programming, which also evaluates us on code legibility and maintainability.
